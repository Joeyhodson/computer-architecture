Project Purpose:
    Simulate a cache and record: memory reads, memory writes, 
    cache hits, cache misses, and total miss ratio (parsed from
    a trace file). Implement two different eviction policies (LRU and FIFO),
    utilize both write-back and write-through policies. Input should
    also take cache associativity and cache size. We assume each block size
    is 64 bytes.

Command Line Arguments: 
    ./out <cache_size> <associativity> <replacement_policy> <write_policy> <trace_file>

    <CACHE_SIZE> is the size of the simulated cache in bytes
    <ASSOC> associativity of cache
    <REPLACEMENT> replacement policy: 0 for LRU, 1 for FIFO
    <WB> Write-back policy: 0 for write-through, 1 for write-back
    <trace_file> trace file name and path

    Example:
    ./out 32768 8 0 1 ./trace_files/TRACE.t
